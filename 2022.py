-------------------
1. Stacks, LIFO > Last In First Out
    Uses:
        To undo tasks:
        Editing a document
        Browsing history
        Backtracking from a dead end in a maze
2. Greedy algorithm
    Makes choice based on local information
    Looks at local minimum instead of global minimum
    May not output the best answer, but does output a good enough answer
    (good enough answer) aka approximation algorithm
    Uses:
        Currency systems
3. Encryption
    Cryptography
    Substitution ciphers can be easily decrypted using frequency analysis
    Alt method to a direct substitution cipher > rotation-based ciphers
    Example: Enigma machine used in WW2
    Uses:
        Databases
        Web Browsers
4. Algorithms
    Conditional decisions
    Repetition (aka loop)
    Certain steps happen only when the condition is true
    Uses:
        Programming languages
        if-then-else statements
5. Simple Algorithm on certain input
    if-statement
    Sequence
    Accepted or Rejected
    Uses:
        Password verification
        Software systems
