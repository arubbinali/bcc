1. Signals
    On & Off / 1s & 0s
    Binary sequence
    ASCII > Character set > 8 signals for each different character
    Codes must be designed carefully, and ensure that they are uniquely decodable codes
        Prefix-free code
            No code is the prefix (or starting sequence) of any other code
    Uses:
        Communication
        Compression algorithms
2. Swapping values bw 2 variables
    Variable > Memory location that can hold information
    Uses:
        Sorting
        Either ascending or descending
3. Machine learning, an area of data science
    Uses large amount of data with various characteristics to identify, categorize, and make decisions

4. Known as a Graph, has:
    vertices aka articulation points
    edges
    path
    Uses:
        Fault tolerance of a network system

5. Conditional expressions such as if-statements
